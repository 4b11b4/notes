# Notes from Zapier's Ultimate Guide To Remote Work (2015 ed)
## How to Run a Remote Team
### 3 Ingredients of a Successful Remote Setup
####  Team
- not everyone can work in a remote environment
- not everyone can manage a remote environment
1. Doers
* Hire people that will get things done no matter what. You don't need to give these people tasks in order for things to get done. They still need direction and guidance, but in the absence of that, things will still happen.
2. Trust
* Remote work does not work when you can't trust the other person who is far on the other  end of the line. If you're worrying about what somebody else is doing, then you're not focusing on what you need to be doing.
3. Trust
* Trust is give and take. You also need to show people that you _can_ trust them. Instead of trying to account for everything everyone does, manage by setting expectations rather than spending time keeping everyone in line.
4. Writing
* In a remote setting, everything is shared via written communication. Communication is crucial for a remote team. Therefore, good writing is extremely important.
5. Social
* People on remote teams need to be OK with a less social work environment. It's important to have some social aspects present with a remote team, but it won't be the same as in person. The best remote workers actually thrive in this environment.

#### Tools
- cannot round up everyone in person to steer things
- need the right tools to make sure everyone can be on the same page
1. Slack
* Slack is a virtual office. If you're in Slack then you're at work. Slack also helps provide some camaraderie. Channels help prevent things from getting too "noisy".
2. Async
* An internal tool built by Zapier. It's a cross between a blog and reddit. It is where important conversations are kept track of that get lost in Slack. It replaces internal email and is a great archive for referencing old discussions.
3. Trello
* Trello is the default roadmap. If there is something to do, it's in Trello.
* It's often you'll find yourself creating too many cards and trying to do too many things. In order to do this there is a minimum requirement of information needed to create a card, so that too many cards don't get created.
* Trello is also used for keeping track of the editorial calendar, support documentation, and really any other project.
* Trello is useful because if anyone needs something to do, they can just look at the Trello and find something positive to do for the company.
4. GitHub
* Issues and pull requests are used for specific purposes at Zapier.
* GitHub houses all code related project management. Pull requests are how features get shipped. Issues are reserved for bugs only. Features happen in Trello.
5. LastPass
* For all of the login/pws.
6. Google Docs & Hackpad
* Google Docs are great for sharing documentation.
* Google Docs fails for organization and collaboration. We use Hackpad for that. Any documentation that needs to teach someone how to do something internally gets added to a pad and a collection inside Hackpad so others can access this collective brain as well.
7. GoToMeeting
8. HelloSign

#### Processes
- processes don't need to be boring and rigid
- they are more about "how we work"
- good processes provide structure and direction for getting things done
1. Support
* Everyone does it. When everyone plays a support role, everyone gets to hear the voice of the customer. If everyone gets to hear the voice of the customer, then everyone has a better understanding of the product that they are building.
2. Culture of shipping
* Each engineer spends 1 week on support out of how many engineers are at Zapier. The other weeks, engineers are 100% dedicated to features. This gives enough time to keep new features coming.
3. Weekly Hangouts
* Every Thursday we get together for lightning talks, demos, and interviews. These hangouts are a chance to see folks you don't normally see, learn something new, etc.
4. Pair Buddies
* As the company grows, it's harder to know all your teammates. One way to mitigate this is to paid up with somebody each week to have an open line of communication for anything. This can be about life, family, etc. Sometimes new features come out of this.
5. Monthly 1-on-1s
* Provide dedicated time for feedback from your supervisor. This is a chance to express concerns, things you see that can be improved, etc.
6. Culture of accountability
- Each Friday, every person posts an update to Async about what they shipped that week and what they are working on next week. It helps keep everyone accountable.
7. Building culture in person
- Strive to bring the team together two times a year.
- Sometimes people fly to each other to coordinate the start of a new project for feature. Seems expensive, but doesn't outweigh the cost of having a central office.
8. Automate anything that can be automated
- The core of Zapier is automation.
- Automation allows the team size to be small and lets them focus on high impact work rather than tedious things.

#### Learn from Others
* The best way to learn about remote working is to ask others about remote working.
