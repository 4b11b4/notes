Excellent lessons.

Each lesson:
1. walked through [steps of] one idea and into another... through to a brand new idea
  * key point: stepping through each idea
     ~ even stepping through all math including basic addition...
         I imagine this is key in... ensuring that the highest number of students are following each step. 
2. Simple
  * Although a few dependencies required... linear algebra, calculus
  * Took some relatively abstract concepts and made them much less abstract

Other notes:
- Collaboration
I find in my engineering and cs classes, there is often little collaboration between students.
   *   Collaboration may be helpful to some students. It may be an effective learning tool. It gives an opportunity for students to play the role of the 'teacher' and reinforce their own understanding.
   *   Side tangent... Lack of collaboration may have worse effects beside a missed opportunity for 'students' ?
       ~ By this I mean... as people with cs degrees may be put in positions of greater 'power', their individual ability to collaborate with their peers grows into a larger scope of 'ethics'.
       ~ To what end can students be presented with the "history" of ethics cases, or exercises of team building...
         ...if they do not each possess an innate ability to collaborate with their peers in the field which they are trained?

One idea of an experiment you could try to increase collaboration:
(this won't work for all lessons)
- Have one student program half, tell output to other student
- Have other student program other half, explain result
* Then combine code
