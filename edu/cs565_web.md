- ES6 may refer to everything above ES6 (e.g. ES2015+)
- ES5 may refer to everything below ES5
- Bootstrap was built on top of jQuery (this is one of the reasons for jQuery's popularity)
  - Bootstrap v5 was built without jQuery. jQuery is losing popularity.
- jQuery is maybe more of a "library" not a framework.

notes:
- With my own wading through the modern web development ecosystem recently...
I was able to follow along and the things you were saying were relevant and actually meant something to me... but I wonder if it went over other's heads.
  - Maybe an introduction of the general ideas of without any names of frameworks?
    - e.g. front end, back end, html, css, js, deploying, compiling (webpack), etc. -- simply just black boxes and how each piece of linked together
