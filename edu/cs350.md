# D@L
- don't nest folders for slides

# Presentation
- cs is already abstract. more visuals? (board.. animations.. etc)
- "make sense?" --> does not illicit feedback
- I wouldn't congratulate students if they did well on the midterm,
  at least publicly in front of the class... makes those who didn't do well...
