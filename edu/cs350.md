# D2L
- don't nest folders for slides. is a pain to click and download
- host a repo for all files? then we can git pull

# Presentation
- cs is already abstract. more visuals? (board.. animations.. etc)
- I wouldn't congratulate students if they did well on the midterm,
  at least publicly in front of the class... makes those who didn't do well...
- suggestion: instead of engaging with only the students who engage __with
  you__, force yourself to engage with all

# Language
- "make sense?" ---> does not actually illicit feedback
- "this is pretty straightforward"
- "should be pretty easy"
- "do you get it?"
