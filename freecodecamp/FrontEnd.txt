- All HTMl elements are rectangles.
- CSS is the <style> element in HTML.
  - You can create your own classes, IDs, or style an html element such as the <body> directly *even if you don't declare <body></body>.
  - You can also <link> to an external CSS file.
  - Overriding CSS classes
    - If an element has two classes that override each other, the class defined at the bottom will override the one defined closer to the top.
    - IDs override CSS classes altogether even at the top of your <style> element.
    - If you use a 'style="color: green"' in an <h1> declaration, this overrides both IDs and classes.
    - A last resort is using the keyword "!important". This can be added to a CSS class in the case where you are using an external CSS library but you want your local definitions to override.
- Margins and Padding "Clockwise Notation"
  - padding: top right bottom left
  - e.g. margin: 40px 10px 10px 20px;
- Colors
  - Hex: 3 or 6 digits
  - RGB
  - using words such as "red", "green"
- Bootstrap... many useful CSS classes already defined for you.
  - Rows: 12 column elements wide
- Font Awesome... many useful icons available for you. Just add a class to the original <i> element for italic.
