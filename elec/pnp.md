* Surface Mount Part Placement (re-order this ANTON!)
1. Place smallest height components first.
2. 0603, 0805, etc resistors are shorter than 0603, 0805, etc capacitors.
3. Place QFNs (or any components with leads on the bottom) before all other parts. Quadruple-check all sides with microscope. These parts are placed before passives which may block the view of the microscope. Re-check all sides before reflow.
- pro tips:
* Place parts as softly as possible. Close your eyes when they are not needed to constantly relieve eye strain.
* Let go of vacuum before placing part. This helps place it as softly as possible. This may only work for small passives and depend on the strength and any leakage of the vacuum.
* Partially uncovering the hole with your thumb can prevent small passives from flying off.
