# How to Succeed with a Startup (Sam Altman)
1. "The degree to which you are successful approximates the degree to which you build a product that is so good, people spontaneously tell their friends about it."
- If you can do this, you have done 80% of the work you need to build a successful startup. In other words, something that people love so much they tell everyone about it.
1. Easy to understand.
- If you can't explain it simply, and if people don't respond by saying "oh that's pretty interesting" - it may be a sign that you haven't thought clearly enough about it or a need that is not big enough.
1. Exponential growth market
- Identify a market that is growing every year and be able to ride that wave. 
4. Real trends vs fake trends
- Before you make a bet on a new platform, make sure it's real.
- Real trends are ones where... a new technology comes along, and the first new users use it obsessively and tell all their friends about it.
-- iPhone: early adopters use it obsessively
- A fake trend is one where people may buy the product but don't use it enough.
-- VR: people use it never, or very rarely
5. Evangelical founder
- Somebody at the startup has to be the person who can infect people and recruit people and talk to investors, press, etc.
6. Ambitious vision
- Never be grandiose - that turns people off.
- But you wanna let yourself grow more ambitious over time. As long as this ambition grows organically, that's fine.
- Ambitious projects are interesting. People want to work on these rather than easy stuff.
- Easy to get employee 1 and 2 if you are successful. But if you don't have an interesting project, why would person #20 join? If you have an interesting challenge, this is easier.7. Confident and definite view of the future
- They may be wrong... so it is good to be confident and flexible...
- but the idea that you are confident and definite... sure of your convictions... this is correlated with success.
8. Huge if it works
- Going for something that is huge if it works will attract the best people.
9. Team
- Only a handful of founders spend enough time recruiting.
- "The team you build is the company you build."
- The team you build, picking the right market, and the right product are the most important htings you do.
- Optimists! Everyone will be telling you that you can't do this or that... if you don't have people who are saying "we will do this regardless", it is hard to be successful.
- Idea generators: people who are just really good at coming up with ideas... you don't want too many of these people. 
- "We'll figure it out" - Sam Altman's favorite thing to hear. Even if you aren't qualified, even if this problem it sounds like it will kill the company... this is the attitude you need.
- "I've got it." You want people who take on responsibility by default.
- Bias towards action: startups win by moving very quickly in the early days. You want people who are willing to act with much less certainty than they'd like, and adapt when they fail.
- The blessing of inexperience: YC has seen startups do many things because nobody told them they couldn't do it.
-- "All the best things I ever did came from having no experience whatsoever, and having no money." - Steve Wozniak
-- Inexperience: not good to have everyone be inexperienced.. helps to have some experience, BUT you can take more bets with than you normally would on inexperience but high potential people.
10. Momentum
- One of the most important jobs as a founder is to never lose momentum.
- For the first few years, you never get to take your foot off the gas, you never get to rest.
- YC openly says that startups are not the best idea for work life balance, at all, especially in the early days.
- Startups survive on their own momentum. If you have momentum, people keep delivering results beyond what they think they are capable of. Making sure that the startup keeps delivering results in a fairly predictable way. 
11. Competitive Advantage over time
- Founders are asked: "What is the long term competitive advantage?"
- This a well-discussed topic. All of the really great businesses have an answer to this question.
- Also known as "the network effect".
- You need to have a plan for this.
12. Business Model
- Need to have at least a sensible business model.
- Doesn't need to have it all figured out, but something.
13. Distribution Strategy
- How are you gonna grow? How are you going to get users?
- Need some sensible idea here.
14. Traits of Best Founders (Paul Boohite)
- Frugality
- Focus
- Obsession
- Love
15. Why Startups Win
- One No vs. One Yes
-- If you're a startup, you only need one yes to keep going.
-- This enables startups to do things that big companies cannot, where an idea only needs one "no" to get shot down. 
- Fast Changing Markets
-- The more a market is changing, the more decisions and tweaks you get to make which make it harder for big companies to keep up in this fast moving market.
- Platform Shifts
-- It has been observed that many startups occur after a platform shift (e.g. iPhone released). Big companies are not good at adjusting to these shifts becasue they are slow (e.g. operate annually). Startups can say, "the world changed last night, let's adjust".
