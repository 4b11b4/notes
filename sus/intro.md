# Creating a Story
- It is [non-intuitively] worthwhile to spend time thinking about the story that you are trying to tell.
- Creating a startup will be one of the hardest things you do in your [professional] career and it is the story which you tell yourself that will keep you going when things get difficult.
- It is the ability to tell this story about "the future you wish you create" that will allow you to resonate with friends, family, cofounders, customers (students), partners and investors.

# Default Towards Positive Action
- This attitude makes for a great environment and default culture.
