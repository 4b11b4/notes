YC CEO Michael Sebiel presents:
Product Fit
* disclaimer: they broke almost all of the rules he is about to present. they were able todo this because their founding team was extremely technical. they also spent barely any money. their startup was also heavily tied to their ego - if they failed, their life was a failure. this was their mindset.

1. What problem are you solving?
- A lot of times the founders have not nailed down a problem.
- Can you state the problem clearly in two sentences? If you can't, you don't know the problem.
- Have you experienced the problem yourself? This is not always required, but is certainly helpful.
- Can you define this problem narrowly? Who can you help first? It's hard to help everyone at the beginning.
- Is the problem solvable? Sometimes you need to define your problem narrowly in order to even ask the question if it is solvable.
- Who is your customer? (it's not everyone) In almost all of the products that "everyone" uses now, there was a time when nobody used them. Who are the first people who are going to use your product?
- How often do they have the problem?
- Who is getting the most value out of this product?
- How intense is the problem? A lot of founders have an idea of solving a problem but they don't do the frequency or intensity analysis.
- Are they willing to pay?
-- Sometimes better to charge to see who your actual customers are, rather than give it away for free.
- How easy are your customers to find?
- Does your MVP actually solve the problem?
- Which customers should you go after first? (the easy ones!)
-- Find the most DESPERATE, DESPERATE people. People who are SCREAMING for your product. These are the people you want to find.
- Which customers should go run away from (the hard ones!)
-- Once you start having customers, it's a helpful exercise to identify bad customers. These are people who are blasting your support, constantly complaining, etc.
- Should you start with a discount or super low price? (no!)
-- Offer discounts with a timeline, but just make the price higher.
- How are you measuring metrics?
-- Need an events based metrics product. This tells you what people click on, how long they spent where, did they leave something in their cart, etc. (Mixpanel, etc). Everyone in the company should be able to use this product. This is not something that one person uses and creates a report from.
-- Make measurement a part of your product spec. You should spec the stats that you think you are tracking, and you should spec the stats that you think are going to improve.
